# Handwriting-to-Print
As we move into the future, more and more mathematical and scientific papers are created digitally. Personally, I used LaTeX and other coding languages to create organized write-ups for math content during undergraduate. I always wished there was an effective way to convert papers I wrote by hand into LaTeX documents. The goal of this project is the create such a program.
# Machine Learning Model for Symbol Recognition
The first step of this project is to create a machine learning model that can effectively classify characters.
